					<h2>Call to Action</h2>

					<div class="12u$"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/solutions_pic01.png" alt="" /></span></div>
					<p>This is what became what is now the final proof of the call to action, including the mission statement above it. Now let's dive into the thought process of this CTA and break down the elements surrounding it.</p>
					<p><strong>It’s Time to Have a Drug Approach Led by Facts</strong> - A Recurring problem with DrugSense as a website is lack of clarity. The interviews proved that more than half the people looking at the site didn’t really know what it was about from the get go. It often makes mention of “Drug Policy Reform” with no explanation on what it meant or what action was being taken. The primary goal of this CTA is to show exactly what we are dealing with and how to solve it all within a few words. “A Drug Approach” is far more accessible than Drug Policy Reform (the user can easily get lost in the wordieness of the latter). “Led by Facts” Implies there is knowledge to gain about this issue, which is the primary Action the user is expected to take, simply clicking on articles that are up to date on current events and information. This is more of a Mission statement than a flat out CTA, but it sets up the CTAs crucially and fills in information gaps that are otherwise lacking.</p>
					<p><strong>Get Informed</strong> - A more Direct version of “Learn More”, and I would argue more successful given the circumstances of the website. This could be a primary button to lead to news articles, or could be scrapped for the articles themselves on the front page.</p>
					<h3>Alternative Button</h3>
					<p><strong>Sign to Stop the War on Drugs</strong> - This is Clear as day on what this CTA is asking from the user. Sign a petition to help stop the War on Drugs. The strength of this one relies on it’s clarity, but it could be wordy for a button. This CTA may still make it into the website, it just isn't present in the main example.</p>

					<h2>Style Tile</h2>
					<div class="12u$"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/solutions_pic02.png" alt="" /></span></div>

					<p>Throughout its creation, I often revolved around the idea of clarity and simplicity, considering that is what the website most needed. The Typography revolves around Univers, a type that revels in specificity and function. Honestly its system of creation reminded me a lot of the legal drug industry. The color choice relies on simplistic, easy to understand colors that have been used in politics as well as drug stores. This decision was made in the absolute interest of clarity, and as one critic said. ‘When I think of red and blue, I think of Drugs”. The Logo was my design, created in contrast to the old logo, again in an attempt to be as simple and clear as possible. The buttons and textures of the site are meant to be serious and eye catching, but they are also meant to carry a tinge of accessibility to all ages of people. Young and old. Although as discussed my audience is primarily young adults, the potential of all other ages crossing through is absolutely a huge possibility.</p>
