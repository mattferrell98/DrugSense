					<h2>Audience</h2>

					<div class="12u$"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/drugsense_pic05.jpg" alt="" /></span></div>

					<p>My sticky note progress ended up a bit different than the guidelines. I basically made a graph chart, where the horizontal axis is considering if the user needs convincing about the War on Drugs issue, while the vertical axis is considering whether the user will be the one giving help, or needing help. This process was landed on because of the nature of the audience. I noticed that many sections in the guidelines overlapped with eachother heavily, so doing it like this made more sense in context.</p>

<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p>This was very helpful for figuring out what audience was for this website. With the data above it can be determined that Young Adults are the primary target audience with the primary objective being to inform them about drug policy issues. The goal needs to be easy to access, non-commital options to help Young People better understand the issue at hand, while still being able to cater to those who want to put money forward. This was further concluded by <em>Interviews</em> which were happening at this time as well.</p>
